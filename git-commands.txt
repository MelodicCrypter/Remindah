//Branch
git checkout hash                                           (this will let you restore a specific log, you can also save it as master if you like)

git checkout master                                         (if you want to return to master, you can also use this to choose a specific branch name)
git branch newBranchname hash                               (after returning to master, you can create a new branch from the specific log you loaded seconds ago)
